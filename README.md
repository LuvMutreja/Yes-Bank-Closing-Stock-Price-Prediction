The project's agenda was to explore the impact of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor on the stock prices of Yes Bank and whether Time Series models or other predictive models could accurately predict the stock's closing price. The dataset used in this project is a Time Series Dataset in which we have to predict the Closing Price of Yes Bank's stock. The dataset contains [Opening,Highest,Lowest,Closing] stock price from July 2005 - November 2020 i.e 14 years 8 months. Each month is represented by a row. The dataset has 185 rows and 5 columns.

To achieve the project's objective, three regression-based machine learning algorithms, were used. Namely Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net and thier accuracy was compared by calculating different evaluation matrics such as R2, adjusted R2, Mean Squaared Error, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error for each of them. The data was preprocessed by performing exploratory data analysis, checking for missing values, handling outliers, data transformation and feature selection. The best model was selected out of the three based on their evaluation metric's scores.

After analyzing the results, it was found that Ridge Regression model performed better than the other models. The Ridge Regression model had better R2 and adjusted R2 values, indicating that the model explained the dependent variable very well using the independent variables. Additionally, the model also showed a lower MSE, RMSE, and MAE value, indicating that it predicted the closing stock price more accurately. Therefore, Ridge Regression was chosen as the final prediction model.

The project's findings suggest that the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor had a significant impact on the stock prices of Yes Bank, and Time Series models or other predictive models can be used to predict the stock's closing price. The results also indicate that Ridge Regression is a suitable model for predicting the stock's closing price of Yes Bank based on the dataset used in this project.

In conclusion, this project aimed to predict the stock closing prices of Yes Bank, a well-known Indian financial institution, using a time series dataset that spans over 14 years. The dataset included monthly information on opening, highest, lowest, and closing stock prices. The main motivation behind this project was to investigate how the fraud case involving the bank's former CEO impacted the stock prices and whether predictive models such as linear regression, ridge regression, and elastic net can accurately capture such situations.

After analyzing the data, we found that ridge regression provided the best results in terms of R2, adjusted R2, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute error. This model showed a good fit to the data and was able to capture the trends and patterns in the dataset, allowing us to make accurate predictions of the stock closing prices. However, it is important to note that these results may be subject to change with additional data or changes in the economic and political landscape.

Overall, this project provides insights into the potential of predictive modeling to forecast the stock prices of financial institutions such as Yes Bank. Future research could explore other machine learning techniques and consider other factors that may influence the stock prices, such as news sentiment analysis, economic indicators, and regulatory changes. With continued development and refinement, predictive models can play an increasingly valuable role in aiding investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

Additionally, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The dataset used in this project only covered the period from July 2005 to November 2020, which may not be sufficient to capture all the factors that impact the stock prices of Yes Bank. There may be other important variables that were not considered in this study that could affect the stock prices. Moreover, the study focused only on the closing price of the stock, and did not consider other important financial indicators such as trading volumes, dividends, and earnings per share.

Furthermore, it is essential to note that the performance of the predictive model may not always be accurate. Even though Ridge Regression provided good results in this study, it is possible that the model may not perform as well when significant changes occur in the market or the economy. Therefore, investors and financial analysts should use caution when relying solely on predictive models for investment decisions.

Finally, it is crucial to emphasize that predictive modeling is just one tool among many that can aid in financial decision-making. Other important factors such as fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and qualitative research should also be considered when making investment decisions. Combining different approaches and tools can lead to more informed and accurate investment decisions.
